## Description

Closing tag without corresponding opening tag

## Details

This error occurs when a closing tag appears without a matching opening tag. This
usually happens when:
- A closing tag is present but the opening tag is missing
- Tags are closed in the wrong order
- A closing tag appears in the wrong context

Example:
```django
<div>Content</div>
{% endif %}  {# No corresponding {% if %} #}
```

Fix:
```django
{% if condition %}
    <div>Content</div>
{% endif %}
```
