# Clients

Django Language Server works with any client that supports the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

### Adding a new client

Documentation for setting up the language server in other clients is sorely needed. Any editor that has [LSP client](https://langserver.org/#:~:text=for%20more%20information.-,LSP%20clients,opensesame%2Dextension%2Dlanguage_server,-Community%20Discussion%20Forums) support should work.

If you get it working in your editor:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the [`docs/clients/`](https://github.com/joshuadavidthomas/django-language-server/tree/main/docs/clients) directory (e.g., `docs/clients/vscode.md`)
2. Include step-by-step setup instructions, any required configuration snippets, and tips for troubleshooting

Your feedback and contributions will help make the setup process smoother for everyone! 🙌
