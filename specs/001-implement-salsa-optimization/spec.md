# Feature Specification: Salsa Optimization for djls-semantic

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-salsa-optimization`  
**Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement Salsa optimization patterns for djls-semantic crate based on PLAN-salsa-optimization.md to improve performance through interning, cycle recovery, and optimal tracking granularity"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Django Language Server, I want the semantic analysis of my Django templates to complete faster when making minor edits, so that I can receive real-time feedback (diagnostics, completions, hover information) without noticeable delays while coding.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a large Django template file is open in the editor, **When** I add a space or newline without changing any semantic content, **Then** the language server should not recompute the entire template analysis and should respond instantly with cached results

2. **Given** a template that extends another template in a chain of 3+ inheritance levels, **When** I request hover information on a block tag, **Then** the system should resolve the inheritance without getting stuck in infinite loops and return the correct block source

3. **Given** multiple template files that use the same tag names and variable paths repeatedly, **When** the language server analyzes these templates, **Then** memory usage should remain efficient through deduplication of common strings

4. **Given** a template with circular inheritance (A extends B, B extends A), **When** the language server analyzes the template, **Then** it should detect the cycle, report an appropriate diagnostic, and continue functioning without crashing

5. **Given** I'm editing a template with 500+ semantic elements, **When** I request variable type information at a specific cursor position, **Then** the response should return within 100ms using cached computation results

### Edge Cases
- What happens when template inheritance creates a cycle of 10+ templates?
- How does system handle templates with 10,000+ semantic elements?
- What happens when the same tag name appears 1,000+ times across files?
- How does the system behave when reformatting changes every line's position but no semantic content?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST cache semantic analysis results and reuse them when template content hasn't semantically changed
- **FR-002**: System MUST deduplicate commonly repeated strings (tag names, variable paths, template paths) across all analyzed templates
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect and gracefully handle circular dependencies in template inheritance chains
- **FR-004**: System MUST NOT invalidate cached analysis when only positions/formatting changes occur
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide sub-100ms response times for hover/completion requests on previously analyzed templates
- **FR-006**: System MUST reduce memory usage through string deduplication (no specific target percentage)
- **FR-007**: System MUST continue functioning correctly when encountering recursive template patterns
- **FR-008**: System MUST track which computations are expensive (>1ms) and only cache those results
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain correctness of all existing language server features (diagnostics, completions, hover)
- **FR-010**: System MUST improve cold-start analysis time by at least 25%
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide accurate type inference for template variables even with complex inheritance
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle templates up to 10MB in size and workspaces with 1000+ template files

### Performance Targets
- **PT-001**: Reformatting operations should trigger <10% recomputation of cached results
- **PT-002**: Memory overhead per repeated string should be reduced to single instance plus reference
- **PT-003**: Circular dependency detection should complete within 100ms even for deep inheritance chains
- **PT-004**: Cache hit rate for repeated queries should exceed 90%

### Key Entities
- **Template Analysis Result**: The complete semantic understanding of a template including all tags, variables, blocks, and their relationships
- **Cached Computation**: An expensive operation result that is stored for reuse when inputs haven't changed
- **Interned String**: A deduplicated string value shared across multiple references to reduce memory
- **Template Inheritance Chain**: The relationship between templates that extend each other, potentially forming cycles
- **Semantic Element**: A meaningful component in a template (tag, variable, block) with associated metadata but independent of position
