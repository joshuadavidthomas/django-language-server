{# now — Exact(2): requires exactly one argument (format string) #}

{# ✓ valid: format string #}
{% now "Y-m-d" %}
{% now "jS F Y H:i" %}

{# NOTE: {% now "Y" as year %} is also valid (4 tokens) but the
   extraction sees Exact(2) from the primary code path. The "as"
   form is handled by a separate branch in Django's source. #}
